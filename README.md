# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor
## Decription
The motivation behind this project was to make the code of this website semantic so it is more accessibility friendly. The project was built so that the site is optimized for search engines. It solves the problem of the website not following accessibility standards. By doing this project I learnt about semantic coding and it's importance.
